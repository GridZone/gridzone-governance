# GridZone DAO

## GridZone DAO

**GridZone DAO** is a next-gen art-focused decentralized autonomous organization**(DAO)** with **gamified social experience**, unique **digital identities**, and **interactive 3D NFT art** on Ethereum.

**GridZone DAO** is governed by a collection of people authorized to act as a single economic entity where everything has strict rules defined by programming code that is **transparent**, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. At its core, **GridZone** is a place where every social interaction is smart contract interaction.

**GridZone** is a paradigm shift in the very idea of economic organization as it offers complete transparency, total shareholder control, unprecedented flexibility, and **autonomous governance**. As a member-owned community without centralized leadership, all agreements are executed in the form of **open-source code** that is self-enforced by the majority consensus of the **GridZone** community.

This **autonomous** behavior is independent of its creator and cannot be censored by one single entity, But instead by a predefined majority of the organization's members. The exact majority rules are defined in the **GridZone** governance smart contract consensus protocol.
