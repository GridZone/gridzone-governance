# GridZone NFT Ride

**GridZone NFT Ride** is a collection of NFT cars and NFT motorcycles within GridZone Metaverse. User can mint those NFT rides on [**GridZone Marketplace**](https://gridzone.io/marketplace)(a Marketplace on GridZone.io where you can mint different kinds of GridZone NFTs)** **with $ZONE and use them in the VR Racing Game(Zone Racer).

Players with NFT rides will have advantages in Racing Game and earn more rewards while playing the game. GridZone NFT rides can be rented to other players so the owners can enjoy rents and rewards while other players playing with their rides.&#x20;

You can still play the racing game If you don't own any GridZone NFT ride, but your reward will be very little and you can not choose your rides but only assigned with random rides in each game.
