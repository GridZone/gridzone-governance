# Twitter BOT

GridZone **Twitter BOT** is designed for GridZone airdrop events. Airdrop participants can connect their Twitter accounts with Twitter BOT to see if they are eligible for the airdrop and claim the airdrops with it.

1000 users who participated in the initial GridZone Fashion NFT airdrop connected their Twitter accounts with Twitter BOT on GridZone.io and claimed their exclusive GridZone Fashion NFTs as rewards for their early support.&#x20;

More airdrop/giveaway events will be organized in the future in GridZone Metaverse with Twitter BOT.
