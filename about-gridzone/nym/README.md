## NYM

On **GridZone**, each identity is represented by a **NYM** "pronounced NIHM and is a shortened form of 'pseudonym' ". **NYMs** are **digital DNA**, a self-representation of a reputable person or establishment in the interactive and collaborative next-gen community. Every **NYM** is a non-fungible token(**NFT**), a true transformation into a binary world with its own unique **digital DNA**, stored on the **Ethereum** blockchain.

**NYM NFTs **offer the user complete ownership of their digital identities which cannot be duplicated nor reproduced. **NYM's** digital identity verification is confirmed through the user's Ethereum wallet by creating a cryptographic signature that authenticates and proves ownership of the **NYM** digital asset.
