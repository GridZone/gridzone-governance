# GridZone BOT

## GridZone BOT

Ethereum smart contract designed to perform various trading and utility tasks. BOT can be augmented with different improvement protocols which enhance its capabilities to benefit the user.

Depending on the type, **BOT** can perform different tasks ranging from staking digital assets in exchange for additional token rewards, NFT minting, and airdrops, to recording the state of a NYM's wallet and claiming rewards in **ZONE** token or **NFTs** based on the balance of the wallet's address at the time of the snapshot.

**BOT** can be augmented to trade, watch and analyze markets, to provide the user with a wide array of useful information with minimal effort. **BOT** can interact with other **BOTs**, and form **Botnets** consisting of many **BOTs** working together for increased rewards.
