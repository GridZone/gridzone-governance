# About GridZone

## What is GridZone?

**GridZone** is a next-gen art-focused gamified social experience on Ethereum with unique digital identities, 3D VR world, and interactive 3D NFT art. 



## GridZone DAO

**Gridzone DAO** is governed by a collection of people authorized to act as a single economic entity where everything has strict rules defined by programming code that is transparent, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. At its core, GridZone is a place where every social interaction is smart contract interaction.

GridZone is a paradigm shift in the very idea of economic organization as it offers complete transparancy, total shareholder control, unprecedented flexibility, and autonomous governance. As a member-owned community without centralized leadership, all agreements are executed in the form of open-source code that is self-enforced by the majority consensus of the GridZone community.

This autonomous behavior is independent of its creator and cannot be censored by one single entity, BUt instead by a predefined majority of the organization's members. The exact majority rules are defined in the GridZOne governance smart contract consensus protocol.

## NYM

On GridZone, all identities are represented by a **NYM** "pronounced NIHM and is a shortened form of 'pseudonym' ". NYMs are digital DNA, a self-representation of a reputable person or establishment in the interactive and collaborative next-gen community. Every NYM is a non-fungible token\(NFT\), a true transformation into a binary world with its own unique digital DNA, stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

NYM NFTs offer the user complete ownership of their digital identities which cannot be duplicated nor reproduced. NYM's digital identity verification is confirmed through the user's Ethereum wallet by creating a cryptographic signature that authenticates and proves ownership of the NYM digital asset.

## Nym HUD

The NYM profile page '**NYM HUD**' provides easy access to many features available to NYMs throughout GridZOne. At the same time, it presents a visual display of the social characteristics that identify each NYM, as well as, personal data associated with a specific NYM that they generate on GridZone.

On GridZIbe, NYMs can connect, build, and join communities or establish businesses. They can create art, generate profits, and have total control over GridZone assets, distribution of resources, and future developments through autonomous governance.

## NymPay

"**NymPay**", a non-custodial payment service, enables direct transfer of digital assets between NYMs through their Ethereum wallets for transfer of funds.

To fully utilize all features throughout GridZone every NYM's interaction with smart contracts\(such as signup and login processes, NFT minting and auctioning, staking, or transfers of funds\), requires Ethereum hardware or software wallet connected to GridZone through Metamask, WalletConnect, or Coinbase WalletLink protocols.

## NymChat

"**NymChat**" is a simple, fast, and free messaging app for NYMs with an instant messaging feature built into GridZone that can be used on Android and iOS mobile devices.

NymChat can be used on any number of devices as all messages sync seamlessly across all NYMs phones, tablets, and computers. Through NymChat, NYMs can create private and group channels, share images and videos, and access their messages from several devices at once.

## GridZone BOT

Ethereum smart contract designed to perform various trading and utility tasks. BOT can be augmented with different improvement protocols which enhance its capabilities to benefit the user.

Depending on the type, BOT can perform different tasks ranging from staking digital assets in exchange for additional token rewards, NFT minting, and airdrops, to recording the state of a NYM's wallet and claiming reards in ZONE token or NFTs based on the balance of the wallet's address at the time of the snapshot.

BOT can be augmented to trade, watch and analyze markets, to provide the user with a wide array of useful information with other BOTs and form Botnets consisting of many BOTs working together for increased rewards.

## Interactive 3D NFT art

As part of GridZone culture. NFT ART is an expression of NYM's creative skills and imagination presented through a series of authentic and distinguishable collectible digital assets that can be minted and auctioned on the GridZOne NFT Marketplace.

GridZonr is exclusive to a selection of **interactive 3D NFT** collectibles. This special type of 3D NFT ART allows real-time interaction and exploration of aesthetic creations in their 3D visual form.

Once acquired, NFT ART provides NYM with various benefits throughout the GridZone.

## GridZone.io \(ZONE\) Token

**GridZOne.io \(ZONE\) Governance token**, a utility token, empowered its owners with the ability to govern the GridZone platform. Not only does it enable of the organization but also allows them to have a voice on how GridZone spends its resource. This way ZOne token holders have total control over GridZonde assets, distribution of profits, and future developments.

## GridZone Governance

GridZone platform is governed and upgraded by the community of GridZone.io \(ZONE\) token holders using three components; the ZONE token, Governor Alpha, and Timelock contracts. Together, these contracts allow the GridZone community to propose, vote, and implement changes throughout the platform.

ZONE token holders are able to make proposals for any platform changes, bote directly, or delegate their votes to representatives who vote on their behalf. In this way, ZONE token holders have total control over voting rights, GridZone assets, distribution of resources, and future developments.

Any address with at least 0.1% \(28,00\) of ZONE tokens delegated to it may propose governance actions. When a proposal is created, the community of ZONE holders can submit their votes during a 3-day voting period.

In addition to direct voting which allows users to vote on proposals directly from their wallet, GridZone voting mechanism also utilizes a delegated voting feature that allows users to delegate their votes to others, making the GridZone platform more of representative democracy.

At least 4% \(1,120,000\) of votes in support of a proposal are required in order for a quorum to be reached and for a vote to succeed. If voting is successful, the proposal is queued in Timelock, and can be implemented after 2 days.
