# About GridZone

## What is GridZone?

**GridZone** is a next-gen art-focused metaverse on **Ethereum** with unique **digital identities**, 3D VR world, and **interactive 3D NFT art**. GridZone is a place where users connect, interact, play, create and participate in a decentralized economy with profound societal impact.



## GridZone DAO

**GridZone DAO** is a next-gen art-focused decentralized autonomous organization**(DAO)** with **gamified social experience**, unique **digital identities**, and **interactive 3D NFT art** on Ethereum.

**GridZone DAO** is governed by a collection of people authorized to act as a single economic entity where everything has strict rules defined by programming code that is **transparent**, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. At its core, **GridZone** is a place where every social interaction is smart contract interaction.

**GridZone** is a paradigm shift in the very idea of economic organization as it offers complete transparency, total shareholder control, unprecedented flexibility, and **autonomous governance**. As a member-owned community without centralized leadership, all agreements are executed in the form of **open-source code** that is self-enforced by the majority consensus of the **GridZone** community.

This **autonomous** behavior is independent of its creator and cannot be censored by one single entity, But instead by a predefined majority of the organization's members. The exact majority rules are defined in the **GridZone** governance smart contract consensus protocol.

## NYM

On **GridZone**, each identity is represented by a **NYM** "pronounced NIHM and is a shortened form of 'pseudonym' ". **NYMs** are **digital DNA**, a self-representation of a reputable person or establishment in the interactive and collaborative next-gen community. Every **NYM** is a non-fungible token(**NFT**), a true transformation into a binary world with its own unique **digital DNA**, stored on the **Ethereum** blockchain.

**NYM NFTs **offer the user complete ownership of their digital identities which cannot be duplicated nor reproduced. **NYM's** digital identity verification is confirmed through the user's Ethereum wallet by creating a cryptographic signature that authenticates and proves ownership of the **NYM** digital asset.

## Nym HUD

The **NYM** profile page '**NYM HUD**' provides easy access to many features available to **NYMs** throughout **GridZone**. At the same time, it presents a visual display of the social characteristics that identify each NYM, as well as, personal data associated with a specific **NYM** that they generate on **GridZone**.

On **GridZone**, **NYMs** can connect, build, and join communities or establish businesses. They can create art, generate profits, and have total control over **GridZone** assets, distribution of resources, and future developments through **autonomous governance**.

## NymPay

"**NymPay**", a non-custodial payment service, enables direct transfer of digital assets between **NYMs** through their **Ethereum** wallets for transfer of funds.

To fully utilize all features throughout **GridZone** every **NYM's** interaction with smart contracts(such as signup and login processes, **NFT** minting and auctioning, staking, or transfers of funds), requires **Ethereum** hardware or software wallet connected to GridZone through **Metamask**, **WalletConnect**, or **Coinbase WalletLink** protocols.

## NymChat

"**NymChat**" is a simple, fast, and free messaging app for **NYMs** with an instant messaging feature built into **GridZone** that can be used on **Android** and **iOS** mobile devices.

**NymChat** can be used on any number of devices as all messages sync seamlessly across all **NYMs** phones, tablets, and computers. Through **NymChat**, **NYMs** can create private and group channels, share images and videos, and access their messages from several devices at once.

## GridZone BOT

Ethereum smart contract designed to perform various trading and utility tasks. BOT can be augmented with different improvement protocols which enhance its capabilities to benefit the user.

Depending on the type, **BOT** can perform different tasks ranging from staking digital assets in exchange for additional token rewards, NFT minting, and airdrops, to recording the state of a NYM's wallet and claiming reards in **ZONE** token or **NFTs** based on the balance of the wallet's address at the time of the snapshot.

**BOT** can be augmented to trade, watch and analyze markets, to provide the user with a wide array of useful information with minimal effort. **BOT** can interact with other **BOTs**, and form **Botnets** consisting of many **BOTs** working together for increased rewards.

## Interactive 3D NFT art

As part of **GridZone** culture. **NFT ART** is an expression of **NYM's** creative skills and imagination presented through a series of authentic and distinguishable collectible digital assets that can be minted and auctioned on the **GridZone NFT Marketplace**.

**GridZone** is exclusive to a selection of interactive** 3D NFT** collectibles. This special type of **3D NFT ART** allows real-time interaction and exploration of aesthetic creations in their **3D** visual form.

Once acquired, **NFT ART** provides **NYM** with various benefits throughout the **GridZone**.

## GridZone.io (ZONE) Token

**GridZone.io (ZONE) Governance token**, a utility token, empowered its owners with the ability to govern the **GridZone** platform. Not only does it enable them to propose and vote on the direction of the organization but also allows them to have a voice on how **GridZone** spends its resources. This way **ZONE** token holders have total control over **GridZone** assets, distribution of profits, and future developments.

## GridZone Governance

**GridZone** platform is governed and upgraded by the community of **GridZone.io** (**ZONE**) token holders using three components; the **ZONE** token, **Governor Alpha**, and **Timelock** contracts. Together, these contracts allow the **GridZone** community to propose, vote, and implement changes throughout the platform.

**ZONE** token holders are able to make proposals for any platform changes, vote directly, or delegate their votes to representatives who vote on their behalf. In this way, ZONE token holders have total control over voting rights, **GridZone** assets, distribution of resources, and future developments.

Any address with at least **0.1%** (**28,000**) of ZONE tokens delegated to it may propose governance actions. When a proposal is created, the community of **ZONE** holders can submit their votes during a 3-day voting period.

In addition to **direct voting** which allows users to vote on proposals directly from their wallet, **GridZone** voting mechanism also utilizes a **delegated voting** feature that allows users to delegate their votes to others, making the **GridZone** platform more of a representative democracy.

At least **4%** (**1,120,000**) of votes in support of a proposal is required in order for a quorum to be reached and for a vote to succeed. If voting is successful, the proposal is queued in **Timelock**, and can be implemented after **2 days**.
